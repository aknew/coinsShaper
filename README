small console program in c++ with opencv which can cut a large image with many coins into many small images of one coin. 

The program has two options:
A. if it has just one file - cut it into individual pictures of coins
B. If has two files - after cutting it looking for the coins, which are intersected by more than 50% and the output is an image of the glued area with two different pictures

App does not know how to define dark or light background, so for definind dark background need use input key -b

In fact, it quickly sketched for the immediate need, so it makes a lot of flaws
